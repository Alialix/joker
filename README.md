positional arguments:

  USERNAMES             One or more usernames to check with social networks.

optional arguments:

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  --version             Display version information and dependencies.

  --verbose, -v, -d, --debug

                        Display extra debugging information and metrics.

  --quiet, -q           Disable debugging information (Default Option).

  --tor, -t             Make requests over TOR; increases runtime; requires

                        TOR to be installed and in system path.

  --unique-tor, -u      Make requests over TOR with new TOR circuit after each

                        request; increases runtime; requires TOR to be

                        installed and in system path.

  --csv                 Create Comma-Separated Values (CSV) File.

  --site SITE_NAME      Limit analysis to just the listed sites. Add multiple

                        options to specify more than one site.

```

For example, run ```python3 joker.py user123```, and all of the accounts

found will be stored in a text file with the username (e.g ```user123.txt```).

## Docker Notes

If you have docker installed you can build an image and run this as a container.

```

docker build -t myjoker-image .

```

Once the image is built joker can be invoked by running the following:

```

docker run --rm myjoker-image user123

```

The optional ```--rm``` flag removes the container filesystem on completion to prevent cruft build-up.  See https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#clean-up---rm

One caveat is the text file that is created will only exist in the container so you will not be able to get at that.

Or you can simply use "Docker Hub" to run `joker`:

```

docker run theyahya/joker user123

```
